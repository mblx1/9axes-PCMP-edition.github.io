<h2>What is 9Axes: PCMP Edition?</h2>
    <p>9Axes (PCMP Edition), based off of <a href="https://8values.github.io/">8values</a> is a political quiz that attempts to assign percentages on nine different political axes, altered to fit contexts of the r/pcmparliament community on Reddit and Discord. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!</p>
    <p>There are two versions of the quiz: a full version with 24 questions per axis, for a total of 216 questions, and a short version with 5 questions per axis, for a total of 45 questions. Feel free to take whichever, however please note that the shorter version is often inaccurate.</p>
